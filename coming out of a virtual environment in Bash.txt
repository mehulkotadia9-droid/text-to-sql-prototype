Great question 👍 — coming out of a virtual environment in Bash is very simple.  

---

## 🖥️ Deactivate the Virtual Environment
When you see `(venv)` at the start of your prompt, it means the environment is active. To exit it, just type:

```bash
deactivate
```

---

## ✅ What Happens
- The `(venv)` disappears from your prompt.
- You’re back in your **system Python** (global environment).
- Your installed packages inside `venv` remain safe — they’re just not active until you re‑enter.

---

## 🖥️ To Reactivate Later
If you want to go back into your project’s environment:
```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

---

So the cycle is:
- **Enter:** `source venv/Scripts/activate`
- **Exit:** `deactivate`

---

Would you like me to also show you how to **check which Python environment is currently active** so you can always confirm whether you’re inside `(venv)` or not?
